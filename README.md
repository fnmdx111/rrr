Ruaruarua
====

Ruaruarua or (RRR) is a high-performance (maybe) ray-tracing renderer.

The goals of it are:

  + A toy.
  + See how SSE instructions can be used in accelerating ray-surface
  intersection.
  + See how C lacks basic data structures in its standard library.
  + See how Lua can integrate with C as a scene scripting language.
  + See how much performance can be gained from various optimizations.
  + See if I can write fluent C programs.
  + There is no seventh goal.

Currently, I am porting my old code from `https://github.com/qwert42/Raytracer`,
which is a naive raytracer implemented in C++.
